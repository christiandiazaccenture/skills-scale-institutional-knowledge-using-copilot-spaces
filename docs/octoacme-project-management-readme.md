# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This README provides a concise summary of how OctoAcme runs projects and links to the detailed process documents in this folder to help onboard new teammates and provide a single-entry point for project delivery practices.

## Quick Overview of Project Management Processes
- Principles: Customer-first, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, psychological safety.
- Lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective.
- Core Roles: Project Manager (PM), Product Manager (PdM), Developers, QA/Testing, Stakeholders.
- Key Artifacts: Project One-pager/Charter, Roadmap & Release Plan, Prioritized Backlog, Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done (DoD), Risk Register, Retrospectives and action items.
- Communication Cadence: Daily standups (team), weekly PM+PdM sync, regular delivery demos, and monthly stakeholder updates. Escalation paths are defined (Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor).
